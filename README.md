## CLI goals  
1. open apps by having a folder of shortcuts to those apps  
2. have a hashmap of aliases to those apps (can be precreated)  
3. have shortcut commands, like fzf-cd, fzf-edit, etc..  
4. have install commands, for init related tasks, like installing fzf for instance  
5. let normal commands of the terminals like bash,cmd,pwsh through
